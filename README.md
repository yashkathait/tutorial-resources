# Tutorial Resources

This repo contains starter apps, samples, and other resources that you may need to use alongside some of the tutorials provided by Plaid. They are not intended to be used as standalone samples. Please see the [Quickstart](https://github.com/plaid/quickstart), the [Tiny Quickstart](https://github.com/plaid/tiny-quickstart), or the [Plaid Pattern](https://github.com/plaid/pattern) samples if you're looking for working sample apps.

## How to use this repository

Every resource should be contained in its own directory, with a `start` and `finished` folder. You should open up the `start` folder and follow along with the corresponding tutorial.

The `finished` folder is there if you get really stuck and need to compare your sample to a working copy. We recommend you don't just copy code from the `finished` folder without going through the tutorial -- you won't learn anything, and we will silently judge you for it. :eyes:
